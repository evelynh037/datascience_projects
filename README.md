### Data cleaning
To explore the question using different analysis tool, data cleaning is needed on the raw data, 
•First step: we discards part of features in the dataframe and only preserve columns with features related to the question, namely columns 'name', 'id', "minutes', 'nutrition', 'n_steps', 'n_ingredients' and 'Average_rating'. By doing this, we eliminated irrelevant data which make our data analyzing process more efficient.
•Second step: we prep our data for further analysis by looking at the types of each columns and identifying which column is need to be typecasted. We found that type casting is needed to be applied on column 'nutrition' since they are string representation of a list with nutrition info like calories, sugar etc as elements. We then extrated these elements from 'nutrition' column, split them and make a new column for each nutrition info in our dataframe. For each new column, we typecasted them into 'float' for further analysis. After getting all info out of the 'nutrition' column, we dropped the column to make the dataframe less redundant.
